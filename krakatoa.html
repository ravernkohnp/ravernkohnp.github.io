                Krakatoa, or Krakatau (Indonesian: Krakatau), is a volcanic island situated in the Sunda Strait between the islands of Java and Sumatra in the Indonesian province of Lampung. The name is also used for the surrounding island group comprising the remnants of a much larger island of three volcanic peaks which was obliterated in a cataclysmic 1883 eruption.

            <h2>Historical Significance</h2>
            <p2>
                The most notable eruptions of Krakatoa culminated in a series of massive explosions over August 26–27, 1883, which were among the most violent volcanic events in recorded history. 
                According to the official records of the Dutch East Indies colony, 165 villages and towns were destroyed near Krakatoa, and 132 were seriously damaged. At least 36,417 people died, and many more thousands were injured, mostly from the tsunamis that followed the explosion. The eruption destroyed two-thirds of the island of Krakatoa.

                        The beginning of the trek cuts through thick jungle. As you come to the main slope of the volcano the vegetation disappears. The slope is made up of small stones and sand and the climb to the top is a hard slow walk. The view from the first peak of Anak Krakatoa (the Child of Krakatoa as the volcano is known) is impressive.

                        Snorkelling around Cabe Lagood and Rataka Island is really special. Within minutes of entering the water you will see anemones, trumpet fish, starfish and beautiful coral. It’s a really great spot for diving and snorkelling and you’ll have plenty of time to explore reefs.
