                    <p style="margin-top:10px;">Derived from the Icelandic phrase meaning "Island Mountain Glacier", the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyjafjallaj%C3%B6kull" target ="_blank" style="color: #0066CC">Eyjafjallajökull volcano</a> lies underneath the Eyjafjalla Glacier. It is located north of Skógar and west of Mýrdalsjökull, within Iceland's East Volcanic zone. The stratovolcano, with a summit elevation of 1651m, is completely covered by an ice cap. It has a 3-4km wide crater open northwards. On the rim, there are three main peaks: Guðnasteinn, Hámundur and Goðasteinn. Since the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_glacial_period" target="_blank" style="color: #0066CC">last glacial period</a>, the volcano has erupted rather frequently, the most recent occurring in 2010.</p>

                        <dt><b>1821 to 1823 eruptions</b></dt>
                        <dd>Some damage was caused by a minor eruption in 1821. Notably, the ash released from the eruption contained a large fraction of fluoride, which in high doses may harm the bone structure of cattle, horses, sheep and humans. The eruption also caused some small and medium glacier runs and flooding in nearby rivers Markarfljót and Holtsá. The eruptive phase started on 19 and 20 December 1821 by a series of explosive eruptions and continued over the next several days. The sources describe heavy ash fall in the area around the volcano, especially to the south and west.</dd>
                        <dd>After that event the sequence of eruptions continued on a more subdued level until June 1822. From the end of June until the beginning of August 1822, another sequence of explosive eruptions followed. The eruption columns were shot to considerable heights, with ashfall in both the far north of the country, in Eyjafjörður, and in the southwest, on the peninsula of Seltjarnarnes near Reykjavík.</dd>
                        <dd>In 1823, some men went hiking up on Eyjafjallajökull to inspect the craters. They discovered a fissure vent near the summit caldera a bit to the west of Guðnasteinn. In early 1823, the nearby volcano Katla under the Mýrdalsjökull ice cap erupted and at the same time steam columns were seen on the summit of Eyjafjallajökull.</dd>
                        <dt><b>2010 eruptions</b></dt>
                        <dd>On 26 February 2010, unusual seismic activity along with rapid expansion of the Earth's crust was registered by the Meteorological Institute of Iceland. This gave geophysicists evidence that magma was pouring from underneath the crust into the magma chamber of the Eyjafjallajökull volcano and that pressure stemming from the process caused the huge crustal displacement at Þorvaldseyri farm. In March 2010, almost three thousand small earthquakes were detected near the volcano, all having a depth of 7–10 kilometres (4.3–6.2 mi). The seismic activity continued to increase and from 3–5 March, close to 3,000 earthquakes were measured at the epicenter of the volcano.</dd>
                        <dd>The eruption is thought to have begun on 20 March 2010, about 8 kilometres (5 mi) east of the top crater of the volcano, on Fimmvörðuháls, the high neck between Eyjafjallajökull and the neighbouring icecap, Mýrdalsjökull. This first eruption, in the form of a fissure vent, did not occur under the glacier and was smaller in scale than had been expected by some geologists. The fissure opened on the north side of Fimmvörðuháls, directly across the popular hiking trail between Skógar, south of the pass, and Þórsmörk, immediately to the north.</dd>

Presidential aide Jacek Sasin initially said a postponement until later that day or even the following day was a "very serious alternative", but it was later announced that the funeral would take place as planned.
